2147483648

-2147483649

if I hit the max value it overflows
if it hit the min value it underflows

but why doesn't my if statementwork?

2147483647 is 0x7FFFFFFF in hex. So when you add 1, you get 0x80000000

but i'm still checking for min and max 2,147,483,647 is 7FFFFFFF

-2,147,483,648 hexadecimal 0x80000000.
